        <mark>1. "Love means enthusiastically answering my many, many questions with an unexpected level of depth, taking care of me when I am sick, indulging my need for spontaneity, making mundane chores manageable (if not fun), and truly seeing my light and looking to amplify rather than dim it."</mark>

       <mark> 2. "At its core, love requires the basics of care. It's people helping each other meet needs, like food and warmth and play. It's trust that my partner is an accurate and healthy mirror for self-reflection and knowing I'm the same for them. It's acting for one another as a framework and foundation for personal evolution."</mark>

        <mark> "Love is like sinking into a warm bath at the end of an awful day. It’s being brave enough to give someone the parts of you that are messy, complicated, and not Instagram-perfect. It’s knowing that although they hold all the tools to break your heart, they’ll build you up instead." </mark>

       <mark> 5. "Love is a trust I place in someone. Love is a space for refuge, for pain, and for growth. Love is walking through a world of cold, dead pain and knowing there are human hearts beating somewhere and that one of them beats for me, and then my heart flutters like a dream come true." </mark>

       <mark> 6. "My emotions wheel says love is a feeling of lightness and security, but I’ve never felt that way. So, to me, love is being present, and the rare moments in the day when I become so absorbed in the sunlight or snowflakes or taste of my ginseng tea that I forget to feel anxious, unwell, or that I should feel like less of a person for taking up space in the world." </mark>
